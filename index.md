## Welcome to My Learning Calculation Tool

![Image](icon-1024.png)

This is a tool to help you learn calculation ability and equation logic. You can define different difficulties for yourself, such as numbers that are easy to make mistakes, or types of difficult arithmetic, to form a new exercise record. At the beginning of each exercise, you need to select a number from your own defined exercise group and another number from the random number group, and analyze which arithmetic type you choose from these two numbers, so that the result value of the equation you are about to get is correct. You can judge your proficiency and help yourself to find a better way to learn how to calculate through the results of each exercise and the highest score in history.

If you have any questions, you can either leave a message or send the questions to our email address.

We will answer them for you in the first time.
